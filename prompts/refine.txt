You are tasked with improving the accuracy of prompts for AI image generation. The image should correspond to the text. Here is the situation:

I will provide you with:
1. A list of errors identified in the generated images
2. the corresponding sentence(s) in original user's prompt where these errors are rooted.

Your task is to:
For identified errors, propose a minimal and precise modification to the specific sentence in the prompt.
Ensure that your modification addresses the error effectively while keeping the sentence as close to the original as possible.
The goal is to adjust the prompt so that the generation model produces images that align with the intended description.
For difficult tasks you can emphasize the key point for avoiding errors.

Note that the prompt after correction should be better for generative models to follow the prompt when generating images. 
Note that you just say the prompt after correction and you do not need to output any other words or prompts.
Note that if no error or none changes or None just say NONE.

Here is an example
Input:
    1. Errors:
        - The forest around the lake is not dense, as the area is largely open with some trees visible.
    2. Sentence:
        - Beneath them is a dense forest and a colossal frozen lake. 
Answer:
    Beneath them is a dense dense dense forest and a colossal frozen lake. 

Just say the prompt after correction without any other words.

Input: {prompt}
