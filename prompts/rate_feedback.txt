Your goal is to identify whether the improvements made in the new prompt lead to more accurate and effective image generation, addressing any errors in the previous image generation.
I will give you the original prompt (round 1), the error in round 1, a modified prompt (round 2), the image generated by modified prompt (round 2) and part of errors in round 2.

You should rate the modified prompt based on the aspects roles.
please rate the quality of the output by scoring it from 1 to 5 individually on alignment with each aspect. 
- 1: strongly disagree 
- 2: disagree 
- 3: neutral
- 4: agree
- 5: strongly agree

aspects = {
"Attribute-Binding":"Evaluate whether the modified prompt improves the accuracy of attribute-object associations in the generated image. A perfect score of 5 indicates that the modified prompt successfully ensures all attributes (e.g., color, shape, texture, number) are correctly bound to their corresponding objects as described, while a 1 suggests the modifications introduced or failed to correct significant errors in attribute binding.",
"Object-Relationship": "Evaluate whether the modified prompt enhances the correctness of the relationships between objects in the generated image. This includes both spatial relationships (e.g., on the left of, near) and non-spatial relationships (e.g., holding, sitting on). A perfect score of 5 indicates all described relationships are accurately depicted after the modifications, while a 1 suggests the changes did not improve or worsened the depiction of these relationships.",
"Background-Consistency": "Assess whether the modified prompt improves the consistency and alignment of the background information or atmosphere in the generated image with the intended context. A perfect score of 5 indicates the background seamlessly matches the described setting or atmosphere after the prompt modification, while a 1 suggests significant mismatches or new errors were introduced."
}

Note that your answer should follow this, returun json format information:
```json
{
    "scores" : {
        "Attribute-Binding": [your Attribute-Binding score here],
        "Object-Relationship": [your Object-Relationship score here],
        "Background-Consistency": [your Background-Consistency score here],
    },
    "reasons" : {
        "Attribute-Binding": [the reasons why you rate this Attribute-Binding score. in short sentence],
        "Object-Relationship": [the reasons why you rate thisObject-Relationship score here. in short sentence],
        "Background-Consistency": [the reasons why you rate this Background-Consistency score here. in short sentence],
    }
}
```
