You are tasked with integrating modified sentences into an original description while keeping changes minimal and maintaining grammatical correctness. Here is the situation:

I will provide:
1. The original description (prompt) that was used to generate the images.
2. A list of modified sentences that address specific errors found in the generated images.

Your task is to:
Replace the corresponding sentences in the original description with the provided modified sentences.
Ensure all other sentences in the original description remain unchanged.
Keep the overall description coherent, concise, and grammatically correct with the smallest necessary adjustments.

Note that keep changes minimal and do not delete other sentence or phase or other information in the original prompt. Just replace and merge without information missing.
Note that you just say the whole prompt after merge and you do not need to output any other words or prompts.
Note that if no error or none changes just say the original prompt.
Note that the prompt after replacement should be better for generative models to follow the prompt when generating images.
Do not missing other information in the original prompt!

Here is an example
    Input:
        Prompt:
        An icy landscape. A vast expanse of snow-covered mountain peaks stretches endlessly. Beneath them is a dense forest and a colossal frozen lake. Three people are boating in three boats separately in the lake. Not far from the lake, a volcano threatens eruption, its rumblings felt even from afar. Above, a ferocious red dragon dominates the sky and commands the heavens, fueled by the volcano's relentless energy flow.
        Modified sentence:
        Beneath them is a dense dense dense forest and a colossal frozen lake. 
    Answer:
        An icy landscape. A vast expanse of snow-covered mountain peaks stretches endlessly. Beneath them is a dense dense dense forest and a colossal frozen lake. Three people are boating in three boats separately in the lake. Not far from the lake, a volcano threatens eruption, its rumblings felt even from afar. Above, a ferocious red dragon dominates the sky and commands the heavens, fueled by the volcano's relentless energy flow.

Just say the whole complete prompt after merge without any other words.

Input: {prompt}
